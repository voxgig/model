"""The second prose gate: the rules Vale cannot express.

Vale carries Google's rules and the banned list (see `.vale.ini`). This
carries the house rules that need to know something Vale does not: which
pages are which, where a tutorial ends, and where a paragraph ends.

    banned-phrases          reject.txt, matched across a line wrap
    em-dashes-are-spaced    the house convention Google rules the other way
    em-dashes-are-rationed  one aside per line
    we-appears-only-in-tutorials
    first-person-singular   stricter than Google's rule
    no-emoji
    internal-documents      documentation never cites a working document
    relative-links-resolve  a link's target exists, inside the repository
    page-set-is-complete    the required pages are all present
    vale-sections-spare-the-pages
                            no blanked .vale.ini section covers a page

Run it directly, or `make scan-prose`. `--files` prints the page set both
gates read, so the Vale invocation and this one cannot drift apart.

Every rule here exists because `.vale.ini` switches a Google rule off in
its favour, or because Google has no rule for it. A rule switched off in
favour of a house rule that is not real is worse than no rule at all --
upstream (jostraca/jostraca, whose gate this is a port of, by way of
voxgig/struct) records finding exactly that, twice.

Usage:
    python3 tools/check_prose.py            # gate the reader-facing pages
    python3 tools/check_prose.py --files    # print the page set, one per line
    python3 tools/check_prose.py a.md b.md  # gate named pages instead

# is worse than not having the check. A reference with no definition is
# reported too: it renders as literal brackets, which is a broken link
# by another name.

# An inline destination may carry a title (`[t](a.md "Title")`) or sit
# in angle brackets to allow a space (`[t](<my file.md>)`); both are
# parsed, and a query string is dropped with the fragment, because

# Vale sections must not cover a page.

# `.vale.ini` blanks the styles for the directories that hold working
# documents and source, so a bare `vale .` does not report the banned
# list against them. Vale matches those section globs against EVERY file
# it is given, named on the command line or not, and an empty
# BasedOnStyles switches off the banned list and every rule that `[*.md]`
# does not name by level (the named ones stay on) -- so a blanked section
# over a directory that also holds a reader-facing page lets banned
# phrases through on that page and reports nothing about them. That is
# the silent hole the explicit file list was meant to rule out, and
# voxgig/model's first draft had it: `[go/**]` covered go/README.md.
#
# Only sections with an EMPTY BasedOnStyles are checked; a section that
# narrows the styles is a choice, not a hole. Vale's globs let `*` and
# `**` cross directory separators, so both become `.*` here.
