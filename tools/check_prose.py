"""The second prose gate: the rules Vale cannot express.

Vale carries Google's rules and the banned list (see `.vale.ini`). This
carries the house rules that need to know something Vale does not: which
pages are which, where a tutorial ends, and where a paragraph ends.

    banned-phrases          reject.txt, matched across a line wrap
    em-dashes-are-spaced    the house convention Google rules the other way
    em-dashes-are-rationed  one aside per line
    we-appears-only-in-tutorials
    first-person-singular   stricter than Google's rule
    no-emoji
    internal-documents      documentation never cites a working document
    relative-links-resolve  a link's target exists, inside the repository
    page-set-is-complete    the required pages are all present

Run it directly, or `make scan-prose`. `--files` prints the page set both
gates read, so the Vale invocation and this one cannot drift apart.

Every rule here exists because `.vale.ini` switches a Google rule off in
its favour, or because Google has no rule for it. A rule switched off in
favour of a house rule that is not real is worse than no rule at all --
upstream (jostraca/jostraca, whose gate this is a port of, by way of
voxgig/struct) records finding exactly that, twice.

Usage:
    python3 tools/check_prose.py            # gate the reader-facing pages
    python3 tools/check_prose.py --files    # print the page set, one per line
    python3 tools/check_prose.py a.md b.md  # gate named pages instead
